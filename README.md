# Coded Thrillers

Short, code driven, stories about how some pieces of code ended up in production environments. Watch how, one wrong step after another, the code got 'better' and 'better'

> Note: This are real pieces of code. Of course, some of the names were changed and business secrets were hidden. But you'll get the picture.

# FAQ

**1. I never wrote code like this. Who did?**

  If you think you never wrote code like this, well, thing again. You did. We all did.

**2. I can't admit I've written this kind of code, but I want to try writting something similar. How can I do it?**

  Here is a quick guide for you:

  - Write code alone only. Don't do pair programming. Don't ask for review. Just don't let anyone see your code.
  - Only write code when you are really, really tired, you have a bad hangover or you are dead drunk.
  - Work on multiple codebases at once. Try multitasking as much as possible.
  - Don't test your code. If it compiles it's good to go.
  - If all the above fail, pretend you are writing code on an old typewriter. You never go back, rewerite/rename/refactor anything.
