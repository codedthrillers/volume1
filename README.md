# Coded Thrillers

Short, code driven, stories about how some pieces of code ended up in production environments. Watch how, one wrong step after another, the code got 'better' and 'better'

> Note: This are real pieces of code with real stories. The only changes I've made were some namings, so noone can guess who's code it is or reveal business secrets.
